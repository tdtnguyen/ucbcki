          <h2>Health Fair</h2>
          <p>
Spring single service involved a health fair at East Oakland Pride Elementary. We planned a mini carnival to teach the children about topics such as personal hygiene and mental health through various game booths and exercises. It was the first event that I was in charge of organizing, and it was really enjoyable to watch the kids so immersed and excited about the activities that we had planned for them.</p>
