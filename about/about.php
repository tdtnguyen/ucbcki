      <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i> The Circle K Golden Gate Division is made up of Circle K clubs in the Bay Area.

      <h2><a href="http://cnhcirclek.org/">CNH District</a></h2>
      <p>The CNH District of Circle K is a supergroup of nine divisions in the three states of California, Nevada, and Hawaii. Other than Golden Gate, there are the Capital, Central Coast, Desert Oasis, Magic Kingdom, Foothill, Metro, Paradise, and Sunset Divisions. These divisions meet together for several annual district-wide events, including Fall Training Conference (FTC), Crazy Kompetition for Infants North/South (CKI North/South), District Large-Scale Service Project (DLSSP), and District Convention (DCON). </p>
      <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i> The Cal-Nev-Ha Spirit. Simply put, there is nothing quite like it. From the mighty Northeastern mountains of Nevada, to the golden West Coast of California and finally, to the tropical paradise found only in Hawaii, the Spirit of CNH is evident in every single thing that we, Circle K'ers, do. Our spirit transcends the usual description of loudness and is represented by the passion for Service, Leadership, and Fellowship that all our members live with. However, this is not to say that CNH CKI isn't loud, because indeed it is. Cal-Nev-Ha is the loudest and proudest District in all of Circle K International and we will never be afraid to prove it. <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></p>

By working together, members achieve what one person cannot accomplish alone. Kiwanis clubs focus on changing the world by serving children, one child and one community at a time. To do this, many clubs also sponsor a Kiwanis family club—K-Kids for primary school children; Builders Clubs for adolescents; Key Clubs for teens; CKI clubs for university students and Aktion Clubs for adults living with disabilities—to reach more people and have a greater service impact on their communities. <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></p>

    <h1>Our Tenets</h1>
    <h2>Service</h2>
    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i> As one of the three tenets, service is the fundamental element of Circle K International. Collectively, Circle K members perform more than one million hours of service on their campuses and in their communities annually. Without service, Circle K International would be just another campus activity. Through service, college students are making the world a better place one service project at a time. Together, Circle K'ers truly make a difference in the community. <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></p>
    <h2>Leadership</h2>
    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i> Through the mission and vision of the organization, Circle K International is dedicated to the realization of humankind’s potential. The potential of Circle K International lies in its ability to positively influence members of society who are facing ultimate personal decisions and those who will one day create the vision of mankind for generations to come. Leadership opportunities afford Circle K members the resources and tools needed to become active citizens. Circle K’ers can assume leadership responsibilities at all levels of the organization and through various experiential training conferences while actively contributing to the running of their respective clubs, divisions, and communities. The unique experiences offered by Circle K truly develop and bring out the leader within each individual. <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></p>
    <h2>Fellowship</h2>
    <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i> If there is one thing that Circle K’ers know best, it is fellowship. Whether they are planning a car wash, visiting shut-ins, reading to three-year-olds or conducting business, Circle K members across the globe take time to meet and welcome new people. With each element and aspect of Circle K International, members experience genuine fellowship and develop life-long relationships with fellow collegians, advisors, Kiwanians and citizens in their communities. Whether a Circle K’er is mentoring a child, networking with a businessman, or bowling with members, that Circle K’er is developing social skills, meeting new people, creating meaningful friendships, and strengthening relationships. <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></p>
