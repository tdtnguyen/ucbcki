      <h1>Welcome to Single Service!</h1>
      <p>Hey there! My name is Joy Xie, and I'm a second-year Business major. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but I moved to Shanghai, China shortly after and grew up there. Apart from single service which I absolutely LOVE, I also enjoy playing badminton, piano, and watching too much Netflix. I am always down for every and any type of food, so hit me up anytime to grab boba and talk!</p>

        <p>Hey everyone! As you are all aware, Circle K International is a community service organization, which also includes planning service events of all sizes. The Single Service chair, me, and my committee will work on planning larger service events around the Berkeley-Oakland area. I want to create <span>fun and memorable service projects</span> that bring great joy to all general members, as well as to the members of our local community. If you're interested in participating in directly creating a large service project, <span>come out to the Single Service committee meetings</span>!  </p>
